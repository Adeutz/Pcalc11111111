# Pay Calculator

Plan your pay year (Dec–Nov): set an income goal, assign pay rates by month, and adjust credit hours on a bar chart to see your resulting income.

**For private use only.** Nothing here is uploaded to a public website unless you choose to.

**iPhone / Safari:** The app runs in Safari on iPhone 13 (and similar) and works **offline** when you open it from the Files app. Bar dragging and the target-line drag work with touch; you can also use the credit-by-month text boxes below the chart to enter values.

## Use on your iPhone (private + offline)

You can run the app entirely from your iPhone using the **Files** app. Nothing is put on the internet.

### 1. Get the folder onto your iPhone

Pick one way:

- **iCloud Drive**  
  Put the whole `PayCalculator` folder (with `index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, etc.) inside iCloud Drive on your Mac or PC. It will show up in the **Files** app on your iPhone under **iCloud Drive**.

- **AirDrop (Mac → iPhone)**  
  In Finder, select the `PayCalculator` folder and AirDrop it to your iPhone. Open the transfer on the iPhone and choose **Save to Files** (e.g. in **On My iPhone** or iCloud Drive).

- **Email or message to yourself**  
  Zip the `PayCalculator` folder on your computer, send the zip to yourself, open the attachment on your iPhone, then tap **Save to Files**. In Files, tap the zip and choose **Uncompress** if needed.

### 2. Open the app on your iPhone

1. Open the **Files** app.
2. Go to where you saved the folder (iCloud Drive, On My iPhone, or Downloads).
3. Open the **PayCalculator** folder.
4. Tap **index.html**.

Safari will open and the app will run. It’s all local — no server, no internet. It works **offline** as long as the folder is on the device.

### 3. Quick access next time

- **Bookmark:** In Safari, tap the Share button → **Add Bookmark** so you can open it from the bookmarks menu.
- **Home Screen:** In Safari, tap Share → **Add to Home Screen** to add a **Pay Calculator** icon. Tapping it will open the app from the file (still private and offline).

## Use on your computer

- **Double‑click** `index.html` to open it in your browser, or  
- Drag `index.html` into Chrome/Edge/Safari.

No server or internet required; everything runs from the file.
