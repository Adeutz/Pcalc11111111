# Pay Calculator

Plan your pay year (Dec–Nov): set an income goal, assign pay rates by month, and adjust credit hours on a bar chart to see your resulting income.

**For private use only.** Nothing here is uploaded to a public website unless you choose to.

---

## Use on your desktop PC (Chrome, with an icon)

Keep the **PayCalculator** folder somewhere permanent (e.g. `Documents\GPTFILES\PayCalculator` or wherever you already have it).

### Option 1: Chrome “Create shortcut” (easiest)

1. Open **Chrome** and open the app: press **Ctrl+O**, go to the PayCalculator folder, select **index.html**, and click Open. (Or drag `index.html` into Chrome.)
2. In Chrome, click the **three dots** (⋮) → **More tools** → **Create shortcut**.
3. Name it **Pay Calculator**. Optionally check **Open as window** if you want it to open in its own window like an app.
4. Click **Create**. A shortcut appears on your desktop.
5. **Pin to taskbar:** Right‑click the new desktop shortcut → **Pin to taskbar**. You can now open it from the taskbar or desktop.

### Option 2: Shortcut that always opens in Chrome

1. Right‑click the desktop → **New** → **Shortcut**.
2. For “What is the location of the item?” paste this (then fix the path to match your folder):
   ```text
   "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" "C:\Users\Alex22Build\Documents\GPTFILES\PayCalculator\index.html"
   ```
   Replace `C:\Users\Alex22Build\Documents\GPTFILES\PayCalculator` with the full path to your PayCalculator folder (e.g. `D:\Apps\PayCalculator`).
3. Click **Next**, name it **Pay Calculator**, click **Finish**.
4. Right‑click the new shortcut → **Pin to taskbar** if you want it on the taskbar.

No server or internet required; everything runs from the file.
